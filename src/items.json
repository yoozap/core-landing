      "question": "What is CORE?",
      "answer": "CORE is Multi Chain PoS Network focused on Interoperability, Scalability and Usability.\nIt utilizes AI Enabled Proof of Stake Algorithm, Multi Layered Consensus Model and Voting Based Governance. <br/><br/> It would attain higher level of Scalability using Advanced Sharding along with Pipelining and Chunking and Parallel Transaction Processing.\nThese technologies have made it possible for the CORE network to be infinitely scalable and to achieve significantly higher throughput and efficiency.\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Why is CORE needed?",
      "answer": "CORE is a solution to all of the current major blockchain problems, namely usability, scalability, throughput, security, and interoperability. CORE solves these issues through its combination of an AI controlled consensus protocol, it's blockchain sharding layer, and its simplified cross-chain communication.\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Who created CORE?",
      "answer": "CORE is community driven and relies on its community members for its continuous development. These members include current and future academics, developers, and engineers present in the CORE community.\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "How many chains can CORE connect?\n",
      "answer": "It is difficult to give a specific limit as to how many chains can be connected to the CORE network. Currently, all of the major public chains and all CORE linked chains can be connected to the network. CORE's optimized and scalable protocol allows for several hundreds, if not thousands, of chain connections to be made to its framework. Future advancements to the protocol may even increase the upper bound on the limit of connected chains as CORE aims to become the internet of blockchains.\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "How does CORE plan to solve the scalability issue?\n",
      "answer": "CORE is able to increase the throughput speed of current blockchain technology linearly through a combination of sharding, pipelining, and its multilayer technology into one cross-shard and cross-chain communication protocol. The protocol is able to take the large number of transactions from a large ecosystem and split them into smaller ecosystems. These smaller ecosystems are then able to process the transactions in parallel to each other and simultaneously communicate live updates to the other ecosystems. These ecosystems are directly correlated to the size of CORE's community. So, as the community grows the ecosystems will grow, resulting in faster throughput of larger volumes.\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Will you make the source code public?\n",
      "answer": "Of course! We can't be a community driven project without making our project open source. Besides that, we believe that there is power in numbers, and that it would benefit the CORE project by not only building a project that incorporates our community's ideology but that also utilizes the exciting intellectual power and skillsets that our community has to offer.\n"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "How can I join the community?\n",
      "answer": "CORE is open source and community centric. We welcome new community members with open arms. Whether it is just to keep up to date with CORE's exciting progress or to contribute to its online platforms, we'd love to hear from you and have you be a part of our growing community!\n"
    },

      "text": "One of the major approaches to overcome the performance and scalability limitations of current blockchain protocols is to use true sharding, which is to split the overhead of processing transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. In parallel, these groups work to optimize performance while requiring substantially smaller communication, computing, and storage per node, enabling the device to scale to large networks. <br/><br/>   CORE is powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning principles at the core of its blockchain- its consensus, together with side chains and off-chain transaction processing to enable both the acceleration of block broadcasting to the chain and scaling out through asynchronous consensus zones. <br/><br/>  CORE overcomes the security concerns associated with blockchain technology, such as 51% attacks and vendor exploits, by combing secure multi-party computation and attribute-based encryption, together with other security practices such as committee reconfiguration and zero knowledge proof. These proven security practices enable anyone to transact freely and securely in the CORE ecosystem. <br/><br/> A lot of research is being done into creating true cross-chain communication between the various blockchains. CORE has combined some of these solutions to create one hybrid cross-chain communication protocol. This hybrid solution makes use of hash-locking, notary schemes, and blockchain bridges, together with trusted relays, side chains, and blockchain migrators. Thus, creating an advanced solution that allows the CORE blockchain to become the internet of blockchains. <br/><br/> Our blockchain ecosystem incorporates a combination of public blockchain sharding, an optimal AI powered consensus, as well as a cross-chain and cross-shard communication protocol into a hybrid solution that is not only Byzantine fault, but also has very high throughputs through block pipelining."
